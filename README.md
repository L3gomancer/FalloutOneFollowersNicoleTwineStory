# Nicole's Dialogue

Click [here](https://l3gomancer.github.io/FalloutOneFollowersNicoleTwineStory/FO%20Nicole.html) to play. This is an interactive fiction, mostly in HTML and CSS, made with [Twine](https://twinery.org). 

It is inspired by dialogue with Nicole, the leader of a [cult of librarians](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nicole), in the first Fallout game.

Twine helped to plan the paths through the dialogue tree:

In the past I tried to plan the dialogue tree in a mind mapping tool with screenshots:
